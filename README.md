# Rental Map Demo
A simple single-page HTML project that shows how rental ads can be displayed on an interactive map. It includes easy filters so users can quickly narrow down listings. This project is meant for learning and experimenting with front-end ideas, not for production use.

## Features
- Interactive map view  
- User-friendly filters (price, type, etc.)  
- Lightweight single HTML file  
- No backend required  
- Easy to extend or modify

## How It Works
Everything runs in the browser.  
You can replace the sample data with any allowed data source. The map loads using standard map libraries, and the filter panel updates the visible markers in real time.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. Modify the sample data or UI as needed

## Folder Structure
/
│── index.html # Main file containing the UI, map, and filters
